<div>
<ul>
    <li><b>-port &lt;nnnn&gt;</b>: the port number the
    selenium server should use (default 4444)</li>

    <li><b>-timeout &lt;nnnn&gt;</b>: an integer number of
    seconds before we should give up</li>

    <li><b>-interactive</b>: puts you into interactive mode.
    See the tutorial for more details</li>

    <li><b>-singleWindow</b>: puts you into a mode where the test web site
        executes in a frame. This mode should only be selected if the
        application under test does not use frames.</li>

    <li><b>-profilesLocation</b>: Specifies the directory that holds
    the profiles that java clients can use to start up selenium.
    Currently supported for Firefox only.</li>

    <li><b>-forcedBrowserMode &lt;browser&gt;</b>: sets the
    browser mode (e.g. "*iexplore" for all sessions, no matter what
    is passed to getNewBrowserSession</li>

    <li><b>-forcedBrowserModeRestOfLine &lt;browser&gt;</b>: sets the
    browser mode to all the remaining tokens on the line
    (e.g. "*custom /some/random/place/iexplore.exe") for all sessions,
    no matter what is passed to getNewBrowserSession</li>

    <li><b>-userExtensions &lt;file&gt;</b>: indicates a
    JavaScript file that will be loaded into selenium</li>

    <li><b>-browserSessionReuse</b>: stops re-initialization
    and spawning of the browser between tests</li>

    <li><b>-avoidProxy</b>: By default, we proxy every
    browser request; set this flag to make the browser use our
    proxy only for URLs containing '/selenium-server'</li>

    <li><b>-firefoxProfileTemplate &lt;dir&gt;</b>: normally,
    we generate a fresh empty Firefox profile every time we launch.
    You can specify a directory to make us copy your profile
    directory instead.</li>

    <li><b>-debug</b>: puts you into debug mode, with more
    trace information and diagnostics</li>

    <li><b>-browserSideLog</b>: enables logging on the browser
    side; logging messages will be transmitted to the server.
    This can affect performance.</li>

    <li><b>-ensureCleanSession</b>: If the browser does not have user
    profiles, make sure every new session has no artifacts from previous
    sessions.  For example, enabling this option will cause all user
    cookies to be archived before launching IE, and restored after IE
    is closed.</li>

    <li><b>-trustAllSSLCertificates</b>: Forces the Selenium proxy to
    trust all SSL certificates. This doesn't work in browsers that don't
    use the Selenium proxy.</li>

    <li><b>-log &lt;LogFileName&gt;</b>: writes lots of debug information
    out to a log file</li>    

    <li><b>-proxyInjectionMode</b>: puts you into proxy
    injection mode, a mode where the selenium server acts as a
    proxy server for all content going to the test application.
    Under this mode, multiple domains can be visited, and the
    following additional flags are supported:</li>

    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <ul>
        <li><b>-dontInjectRegex &lt;regex&gt;</b>: an
        optional regular expression that proxy injection mode can
        use to know when to bypss injection</li>

        <li><b>-userJsInjection &lt;file&gt;</b>: specifies a
        JavaScript file which will then be injected into all
        pages</li>

        <li><b>-userContentTransformation &lt;regex&gt;
        &lt;replacement&gt;</b>: a regular expression which is
        matched against all test HTML content; the second is a
        string which will replace matches. These flags can be used
        any number of times. A simple example of how this could be
        useful: if you add "-userContentTransformation https http"
        then all "https" strings in the HTML of the test
        application will be changed to be "http".</li>
      </ul>
